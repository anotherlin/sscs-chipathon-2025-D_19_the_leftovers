Goal was originally to implement a full adder (s = a ^ b ^ c_in, c_out = (a & b) + (b & c) + (c & a)) standard cell. But to gain insight, we may just start by implementing XOR and XNOR standard cells.





# Current status

* Switch level verilog written and verified that the 4 and 6 transistors implementations of XOR and XNOR are correct.
* Basic "conceptual" schematics drawn for 4 and 6 transistors implementation using xschem.

# Things (apparently) working

* Verilog switch level 

# TODO, ordered by priority:

1. Simulate proposed 4 and 6 transistors im
    
2. Propose input and output buffered implementations of
